\description{
  Statistical inference for risk SNPs.
}
\usage{
assoc.SNP(fit, FDRset = 0.1, fdrControl)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{fit}{
     LSMM model fit.
}
  \item{FDRset}{
     FDR level.
}
  \item{fdrControl}{
     Method to control FDR. Possible values are "global" (global FDR control) and "local" (local FDR control).
}
}
\details{
  \code{assoc.SNP} makes statistical inference for risk SNPs.
}
\value{
List of binary values indicating association of SNPs for the phenotype, where one indicates that the SNP is associated with the phenotype and zero otherwise
  \item{gamma.stage1}{
     Estimation of latent status that each SNP is associated with this phenotype in the stage1 (i.e., under the Two Groups Model).
}
  \item{gamma.stage2}{
     Estimation of latent status that each SNP is associated with this phenotype in the stage2 (i.e., under the LFM).
}
  \item{gamma}{
     Estimation of latent status that each SNP is associated with this phenotype in the main stage (i.e., under the LSMM).
