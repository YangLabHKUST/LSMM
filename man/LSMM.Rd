%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Pvalue}{
     p-value from GWAS data, the length is the number of SNPs.
}
  \item{Z}{
     Design matrix of fixed effects without intercept, where row and column correspond to SNP and annotation, respectively. Default is \code{NULL}.
}
  \item{A}{
     Design matrix of random effects, where row and column correspond to SNP and annotation, respectively. Default is \code{NULL}.
}
  \item{alpha}{
     Initial value of parameter \code{alpha} in the Beta distribution which is between 0 and 1. Default is 0.1.
}
  \item{pi1_}{
     Initial value of parameter pi1 which is the proportion that gamma equals 1. Default is 0.1.
}
  \item{maxiter}{
     Maximum number of EM iteration. Default is 10000.
}
  \item{tol}{
     Threshold to stop the EM iteration. Default is 1e-06.
}

\details{
  \code{LSMM} fits the LSMM. It requires to provide GWAS p-value to \code{Pvalue}, while users can also provide annotation data to \code{Z} and \code{A} which correspond to fixed-effects and random-effects respectively. It is assumed that the length of \code{Pvalue} equals to the number of rows of matrix provided to \code{Z} and \code{A}.

  \code{assoc.SNP} makes statistical inference of risk SNPs. It requires LSMM model fit. The results can be obtained by setting the type of FDR and the corresponding FDR threshold.

  \code{relev.Anno} makes statistical inference of relevant tissue-specific functional annotations. It requires LSMM model fit. The results can be obtained by setting the type of FDR and the corresponding FDR threshold.
