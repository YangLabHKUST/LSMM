\section{Overview}

This vignette provides an introduction to the `\texttt{LSMM}' package.
R package `\texttt{LSMM}' implements LSMM (Latent Sparse Mixed Model),
an efficient statistical approach to integrating functional annotations with genome-wide association studies. It provides model parameter estimation as well as statistical inference.

The package can be loaded with the command:

<<preliminaries,echo=FALSE,results=hide>>=
options(prompt = "R> ")
@

<<LSMM-prelim>>=
library("LSMM")
@

This vignette is organized as follows.
Section \ref{fitting} discusses how to fit LSMM in various settings.
Section \ref{association} explains command lines for statistical inference for identification of risk SNPs and detection of relevant annotations using LSMM.

Please feel free to contact Can Yang at \texttt{macyang@ust.hk} for any questions or suggestions regarding the `\texttt{LSMM}' package.

\section{Workflow}\label{workflow}

In this vignette, we use the simulated ExampleData in the package. We set the number of SNPs, fixed effects and random effects to be $M=100,000$, $L=10$ and $K=500$ respectively. Users can find the $p$-value in the `\texttt{ExampleData\$Pvalue}', design matrix for fixed effects and random effects in `\texttt{ExampleData\$Z}' and `\texttt{ExampleData\$A}' respectively.

<<LSMMExample-prelim>>=

data(ExampleData)
Pvalue <- ExampleData$Pvalue
Z <- ExampleData$Z
A <- ExampleData$A
length(Pvalue)
dim(Z)
dim(A)
@
The length of `\texttt{Pvalue}' is assumed to be the same as the number of rows of matrix provided to `\texttt{Z}' and `\texttt{A}'. When we analyze real data, we need to ensure that the $j$-th ($j=1,...,M$) row of `\texttt{Pvalue}', `\texttt{Z}' and `\texttt{A}' corresponds to the same SNPs.

\subsection{Fitting the LSMM}\label{fitting}

We are now ready to fit LSMM using the data described above.
R package \texttt{LSMM} provides flexible analysis framework
and automatically adjusts its model structure based on the provided data.

First, assuming that there is no annotation data, we fit LSMM with the command:
<<LSMM-noZA-show,eval=FALSE>>=
fit.LSMM.noZA <- LSMM(Pvalue, Z = NULL, A = NULL)
@
or equivalently (which is actually simpler command),
<<LSMM-noZA-simple,eval=FALSE>>=
fit.LSMM.noZA <- LSMM(Pvalue)
@
Now, LSMM reduces to the Two Groups Model.

When we also have functional annotation data, this annotation data can be easily incorporated into LSMM by providing it in the second or the third argument of `\texttt{LSMM}' function. The second argument is regarded as fixed effect and the third argument is regarded as random effect.
If we only consider fixed effects, then we can fit LSMM with the command:
<<LSMM-Z-show,eval=FALSE>>=
fit.LSMM.Z <- LSMM(Pvalue, Z = Z, A = NULL)
@
If we only consider random effects,
<<LSMM-A-show,eval=FALSE>>=
fit.LSMM.A <- LSMM(Pvalue, Z = NULL, A = A)
@
If we consider both fixed and random effects,
%<<LSMM-ZA-show,echo=TRUE, results=hide>>=
<<LSMM-ZA-show>>=
fit.LSMM.ZA <- LSMM(Pvalue, Z = Z, A = A)
@
`\texttt{fit.LSMM.ZA}' is a list containing parameter estimation, the posterior probability and iteration times of each stage and the value of lower bound of log-likelihood.
<<LSMM-show-ZA>>=
str(fit.LSMM.ZA)
@

\subsection{Statistical inference for detection of risk SNPs and relevant tissue-specific annotations}\label{association}

Now, based on the fitted LSMM, we can make statistical inference for identification of risk SNPs:
<<LSMM-assoc.SNP>>=
assoc.SNP.LSMM <- assoc.SNP(fit.LSMM.ZA, FDRset = 0.1, fdrControl="global")
str(assoc.SNP.LSMM)
table(assoc.SNP.LSMM$gamma.stage1)
table(assoc.SNP.LSMM$gamma.stage2)
table(assoc.SNP.LSMM$gamma)
@
`\texttt{assoc.SNP}' function returns list of binary values indicating association of SNPs for the phenotype under different stages, where one indicates that the SNP is associated with the phenotype and zero otherwise. `\texttt{assoc.SNP}' allows both local (`\texttt{fdrControl="local"}') and global FDR controls (`\texttt{fdrControl="global"}') and users can set the threshold using the argument `\texttt{FDRset}'. For ExampleData, Two Groups Model (stage1) detected 15277 SNPs, whereas LFM which uses fixed effects (stage2) and LSMM which integrates
both fixed effects and random effect identified 15602 and 25059 SNPs respectively, under the global FDR control at 0.1 level.

We can also make statistical inference for detection of relevant annotations:
<<LSMM-relev.Anno>>=
relev.Anno.LSMM <- relev.Anno(fit.LSMM.ZA, FDRset = 0.1, fdrControl="local")
str(relev.Anno.LSMM)
table(relev.Anno.LSMM)
@
`\texttt{relev.Anno}' function returns a list of binary values indicating relevance of annotations for the phenotype, where one indicates that the annotation is relevant to the phenotype and zero otherwise. `\texttt{relev.Anno}' allows both local (`\texttt{fdrControl="local"}') and global FDR controls (`\texttt{fdrControl="global"}') and users can set the threshold using the argument `\texttt{FDRset}'. For ExampleData, LSMM identified 78 relevant annotations, under the local FDR control at 0.1 level.
